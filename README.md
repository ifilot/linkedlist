# Purpose
This very simple program showcases how to construct linked lists using pointers. This code should by no means be used for any kind of production work. The STD library actually has a linked list which is optimized and maintained for exactly this purpose. This is purely made for educational purposes and might not necessarily have the best programming patterns in mind.

# Compilation instructions
As "usual":

Under Windows
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..\src -G  "NMake Makefiles"
nmake
```
